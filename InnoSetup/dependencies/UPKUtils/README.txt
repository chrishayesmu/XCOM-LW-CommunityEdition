This directory contains source code and binaries for UPKUtils, an excellent collection of tools created by WGhost81. Long War: Community Edition's installer uses these to modify a few of the game files during installation.

UPKUtils is licensed under GPL v2, which allows distribution of the binaries while requiring their source code to also be provided. That source code can be found in the file "UPKUtils-7.3 source.zip", located in the same directory as this README. Also included in that directory is the LICENSE.txt file for UPKUtils.

NOTE: Long War: Community Edition is NOT a derived work of UPKUtils, and is NOT published under GPL v2. The LICENSE.txt located here applies ONLY to UPKUtils.

The latest version of UPKUtils can also be found at https://github.com/wghost/UPKUtils

Much thanks to WGhost81 for making these tools and licensing them freely! Long War: Community Edition would not exist without them.
