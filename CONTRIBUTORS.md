## Special thanks

As always, a huge thank you to [Firaxis Games](https://firaxis.com/) for creating XCOM: Enemy Within, a fantastic game even before the community got involved.

Our enormous gratitude as well to the folks at [Pavonis Interactive](https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/) for developing the Long War mod, and showing us all the depths of what is possible. Make sure to check out their upcoming game [Terra Invicta](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1176470/Terra_Invicta/) and wishlist it on Steam!

The XCOM modding community is too big to thank individually, but we'd like to shout out [wghost](https://github.com/wghost/), whose work on UPK tools and XCOM mutators quite literally made this project possible. We also give our thanks to the authors of [XCOM Mini Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/735), who made their source code available; it has been very helpful.
