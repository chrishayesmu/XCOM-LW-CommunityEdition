Going forward with this project will double our interceptors' chances of detecting alien craft on the same continent absent satellite coverage over a given country."

[Foundry_WingtipSparrowhawks LWCEFoundryProjectTemplate]
strName="Wingtip Sparrowhawks"
strSummary="Because of the fuel needed to attain the high speeds and altitudes necessary to engage the alien UFOs, we have been unable to mount multiple weapons systems on our interceptors. We believe that by employing alien alloys and meld to construct some lightweight weapon hard points, we should be able to mount pods of Sparrowhawk missiles, which are similar to our Stingrays but with smaller warheads, on our fighters. These can be employed in addition to whatever swappable weapon you choose to mount. This requires significant and costly modifications to all our airframes."

[Tech_AdvancedAerospaceConcepts LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Advanced Aerospace Concepts"
strSummary="\"Our growing understanding of the aliens' fantastic new materials has given us several ideas on ways to improve our capabilities in the skies. Our intelligence indicates the aliens are continually improving their UFOs, so research in this direction should enable us to develop systems that will allow us to keep up.\""
strCodeName="Skyhook"
strReport="While this line of research didn't immediately lend itself to a new line of alien-technology-derived products, it has bridged the gap between our theoretical understandings of UFO technology and our present systems of aircraft engineering. We believe that specialized engineering teams may be able to develop several projects that can improve our aircraft combat capabilities. We gained a greater understanding, in particular, of the armored alien UFOs, such as the fighter and destroyer. Even though they do not do as much overall damage as other weapons, we should be sure to employ armor-piercing weaponry, like the Stingray Missile, against them."

[Tech_AdvancedBeamLasers LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Advanced Beam Lasers"
strSummary="\"We believe we should be able to develop some more specialized beam weaponry for some of the troops. Our early experiments with oversized coolant coils and double lensing have shown the potential to greatly increase their firepower.\""
strCodeName="Lightwire"
strReport="After a number of failed experiments, we've finally succeeded in focusing an energy beam through a narrow-field lens while still maintaining adequate energy efficiency. The result are extremely capable weapons that have a much greater chance of inflicting critical damage on targets. We believe these weapons are now ready for deployment in the field, once Dr. Shen and his team complete the fabrication process. \n\nDuring our testing, we've also developed another prototype operating under the same principle, but relying on a modified prism to scatter the beam rather than focus it. We envision this weapon filling the same tactical role as a traditional shotgun, but without the ammunition constraints... and with greater damage output. However, as with our other laser-based weaponry, heat dissipation issues continue to plague these designs. \n\nWhile developing these systems for our troops, we also blueprinted a variation suitable for mounting to our Interceptors. Attaching this weapon to one of the ship's hardpoints should provide a significant boost in firepower to our pilots when engaging the alien craft."

[Tech_AdvancedBodyArmor LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Advanced Body Armor"
strSummary="\"Now that we have established the foundations of building improved armor for our troops, we believe can develop even better protection and add a climbing grapple that we've been prototyping to one type of armor.\""

[Tech_AdvancedPlasmaWeapons LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Advanced Plasma Weapons"
strSummary="\"An amazing piece of technology - this rifle maintains a seemingly normal form factor while housing a fully functional plasma generator inside. Even the most modern of our current power generation facilities on Earth are less efficient than this small device.\""
strCodeName="Kestral"
strCustom="We may now use alien plasma rifle cores to build our own plasma small arms."
strReport="It took an extensive effort by the research team to reduce the considerable mass of the larger alien plasma rifle. By replacing the outer frame components with composite materials, we've managed to substantially reduce the weight, without compromising the weapon's power output or accuracy. These reductions did coincide with the added heft of a larger power supply, but we still managed to net an overall reduction of several kilograms. The substantial increases in firing rate and overall damage output versus our other prototype variants also required some additional modifications to the integrated Elerium power cell. \n\nThe end result of this work is a highly advanced, mobile plasma discharge weapon that improves on nearly all aspects of the conventional X-9 rifle. I believe the engineering team is now on standby to begin production of this weapon at your discretion. Alien rifles recovered from the field will be necessary to construct our own with the techniques we've developed."

[Tech_AdvancedPowerArmor LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Advanced Power Armor"
strSummary="\"We've observed some of the alien combatants wearing a form of superheavy armor that still allows for full mobility in combat. This has been puzzling, to say the least, but with our new understanding of the alien energy sources and their materials, we could develop powered armor of our own, as well as further enhance our MECs' capabilities.\""
strCodeName="Golem"
strReport="Among the heaviest of our body armor prototypes, the \"Titan\" armor makes use of the complex alien power management systems to provide a continual powered assist to the operator of this suit as they move through the battlefield. With the element in short supply, we've tried to find the most efficient means to utilize it in our development programs.\n\nIn this case, the Elerium power cell is used to fuel an integrated cooling system designed to minimize fatigue by regulating the operator's body temperature. This system gives the Titan Armor the added benefit of increased resistance to environmental hazards, particularly fire and acid damage."

[Tech_AdvancedPulseLasers LWCETechTemplate]

strCodeName="Shiva"
strReport="Dr. Shen's suppositions about the capabilities of the Meld substance that would allow us to combine humans and machines have borne out. We now believe we can build the sort of mobile battlesuits imagined only in science fiction, and use the Meld to modify the wearer to allow him or her to interface directly with the complex control and power systems such suits entail. We'll need to build new facilities and seek volunteers from the troops who are willing to undergo the surgeries necessary to make the suits work. We also believe this will open up several new research pathways."

strSummary="\"The device we recovered from the Ethereal craft may be the final piece of the puzzle... the key to their psionic connection... and to the ultimate source of their power. With a better understanding of this technology, I believe we'll be on the brink of finding the source of this invasion.\""
strCodeName="Skylight"
strReport="Having learned a great deal about the Hyperwave Beacon and its associated \"inter-dimensional\" signaling capabilities, we believe this newly recovered device confirms our suspicions about this technology and takes it a step further. The \"Psi-Link,\" as it is now being called, appears to provide a direct link to the psionic \"network\" used by the aliens for field communications. Although we are treading into an area of highly theoretical science, we believe there is a strong indication that the aliens function under a collective consciousness, a form of social organization akin to a \"hive mind\" as seen in various species of insects found on Earth. It wasn't until our first interaction with the Ethereal species of alien that we were able to understand the scope of the psionic abilities we had previously been exposed to. \n\nAlthough we've only scratched the surface in terms of developing Psionic abilities within a human subject, we've now theorized that it may be possible to join the aliens' consciousness ... to tap into their \"hive mind,\"  by successfully activating this device. \n\nHowever, in order to ensure the safety of XCOM's headquarters, we'll need to construct a chamber that minimizes the potential risks to the rest of the facility during the activation process. As it so happens, two of our brightest young minds, a team of brothers, have already conceived of just such a facility appropriate to this task. If we manage to locate a soldier with an aptitude for psionics, and find a means to develop these abilities further, I believe it will only be a matter of time before we succeed in activating the device and finding the source of this invasion."

strCodeName="Tachyon"
strReport="Although we've studied a number of unusual pieces of alien technology up to this point, the equipment recovered from the alien base on Earth is among the most cryptic. When we first encountered this device, it appeared that the Sectoid Commander was somehow interacting with it through a non-physical link...using some type of mental telepathy or another equally mysterious form of communication. \n\nHaving now studied the device further, we believe this is undoubtedly the case. Our testing has revealed a pattern of signals being transmitted at a wavelength never before associated with any form of communications or electronic transmissions. Although we should not be surprised at this point by the advanced nature of the alien technology, this particular discovery is a bit...unsettling. \n\nAs far-fetched as it may seem, several members of the research team have theorized that this device may be capable of transmitting and receiving signals beyond our own dimension. The implications of this possibility affect all areas of known science, and perhaps most alarmingly, indicate that the Sectoid Commander may have been receiving signals or...orders...from a higher authority.\n\nWhile continuing to analyze the transmission we've detected, we have also moved forward in our attempts to interface the device with our own satellite communications network. If my suspicions are correct, this beacon may provide us with a means of detecting previously unknown contacts."

strSummary="\"Computer hardware we have recovered from a crashed UFO offers the opportunity to advance our understanding of alien machinery and information systems, both large and small.\""
strCodeName="Lighthouse"
strReport="We've had the opportunity to study these devices in a limited fashion. As we discovered, they do contain some form of encrypted alien data. However, they're also completely reliant on an internal power supply, which, when depleted, renders the device inaccessible. The only means we've found to gather information from this equipment is by routing its internal power system through a crudely assembled interface that bypasses any built-in shutdown sequences. \n\nHowever, the alien data itself presented an even greater obstacle, as we're dealing with a programming language that is unlike anything found in our own systems. Fortunately, the research team is quite capable, and we quickly assembled a small group of our best analysts for the task. We've already begun to establish patterns in the alien encryption algorithm, revealing small bits of information that can be integrated into our research. We've also achieved a far greater understanding of how alien materials are incorporated into their hardware."

strCodeName="Looking Glass"
strReport="Our understanding of the alien materials is limited at best, and we could spend years deciphering the complex manufacturing processes required to produce and manipulate these substances. However, we have managed to crudely adapt some of the observed techniques into our own research. Our first development, a multi-walled carbon nanotube weave, was modeled after an unusual pattern mirrored in several of the alien materials. This new configuration has proven to possess a greater tensile strength than any material previously recorded in known science. Adapting this fiber into an armor reinforcing vest will surely afford our soldiers increased protection on the battlefield."

strCodeName="Novato"
strReport="Analysis of the alien shard has revealed that it is indeed organic in nature, although not \"alive\" per se,  somehow it continues to resonate within a specific range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite several attempts at disabling the alien known as the \"Outsider,\" each was met with the same result - the target \"dematerializing\" within an instant. With no explanation for this phenomenon, the research team was left with little to study in terms of the Outsider itself. However, having now analyzed this shard, it seems that may not be the case.\n\n In an effort to reduce any potential interference from known terrestrial signals, we placed the shard into the \"harmonic dampening chamber,\"a device conceived of by Dr. Shen. With outside noise brought to a minimum, it took little effort to detect a very distinct signal...the source of our shard's \"hum.\" \n\nWhile we have a number of theories, both the Research and Engineering teams seem to be in agreement... the shard itself is acting as some form of communications relay. Although purely speculative, we've also considered the possibility that the Outsider itself is merely an extension of the shard and its function. Dr. Shen believes with sufficient time, he may be able to develop a device or \"key\" that mimics the shard itself, giving us a means to locate the source of the signal."

strCodeName="Waterfall"
strReport="The power supply systems recovered from the alien craft are perhaps the most important piece of technology we've retrieved so far. Although we could spend years researching the intricacies of this equipment, the urgency of our development process means we've had to rely on theoretical analysis more than I would prefer. Despite the risks involved in attempting to reverse engineer this technology, we made a number of small steps towards a fully adapted power cell. Our most important discovery so far, the element we've been referring to as \"Elerium,\" is the vital component that provides nearly limitless energy to the alien power cells. \n\nAlthough there is still much to learn, we believe it should be possible for the Engineering team to begin assembling a makeshift power cell based on our initial findings, which may prove useful in the development of an advanced fighter craft, as well as to power a more advanced MEC. However, we'll certainly want to do further analysis of the Elerium element that fuels the alien power systems."

strCodeName="Skylance"
strReport="After an exhaustive reverse-engineering effort by the research team, we now believe it should be possible to mirror the functionality exhibited by the alien's advanced flight and navigational computers. These systems provide the pilot with a depth of information well-beyond our current avionics package, and will certainly bring us closer to matching the alien ships in combat.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, we've successfully integrated our first prototype of the \"gravity wave\" drive we modeled after the alien propulsion systems. With this mechanism in place, we can expect a massive increase in the Firestorm's maximum thrust output when compared to our traditional pulse-engine equipped Interceptors. \n\nAssuming Dr. Shen and his team are able to successfully complete the fabrication process, our ship should be every bit as fast and deadly as the aliens' own craft."

However, I have been encouraged by the rapid developments the research team has made in studying the damaged circuitry and electronics we recovered. Our initial efforts have already yielded a successful outcome. The new integrated sighting module created for our weaponry was heavily influenced by the aliens' own targeting system."

Having successfully developed a miniaturized version of the alien propulsion modules recovered from the field, we've now successfully integrated this device into a suit of heavy armor. Although we've exceeded the weight of the original Floater specimen these propulsion units were adapted from, we believe our adjustments to the system have actually improved their overall efficiency. As a result of our efforts, this suit is capable of providing limited flight capabilities to the wearer."

strReport="Although similar to the previously catalogued Muton species, this particular specimen is... different. Our troops have taken to calling this beast the \"Berserker,\" based on its uncharacteristically aggressive tactics in the field. Despite sharing the same physiological structure of the other Mutons, for reasons yet unknown to us, the Berserker seems to be consumed by blood lust, charging into combat with little regard for its own safety. Current theories as to the cause of this behavior have led us to begin investigating possible genetic manipulation of the subject's endocrine glands, or, in this case, the equivalent glands that appear to secrete androgenic hormones. If the aliens enlarged or modified the action of these glands, it could explain the Berserker's outbursts. Specifics on this creature's abilities in combat should be available when using the Unit Analysis View on another specimen of the same type in the field."

strCodeName="Ridley"
strReport="Even after years of research and study, until now I had never encountered something that is quite as beautiful, yet equally as deadly, as this species. Unlike the other aliens we've encountered thus far, it is arthropodal in nature, plated in a sleek, black exoskeleton. The \"Chryssalids,\" as we're calling them, based on their reproductive habits, measure over three meters long from nose to tail, and stand almost two meters high when perched on their hind legs. Their attack is not only extremely deadly, but also necessary for their reproduction, as the intended victim is not immediately killed, but instead turned into what can only be described as a mindless shell, akin to a zombie, which serves as host to its offspring. When a human is bitten, an embryo is injected into the host and immediately begins to gestate. Once gestation is complete, which remarkably lasts only minutes, a newborn Chryssalid will emerge, destroying its host in the process. \n\nWe can only theorize as to why the aliens would utilize what appears to be a savage, unpredictable creature... in any case, this is certainly not a creature to be trifled with, and our troops would do well to exercise extreme caution when engaging this species. Targeting another example in the field through the Unit Analysis View may provide additional information as to its combat capabilities.\n\nOne final note, which may be of particular interest in regards to our own genetic enhancement work - we have finally managed to isolate the Chryssalid exoskeleton's regenerative capabilities.

Based on our findings, it has an alternative biochemical system based on the silicon atom. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information, and since silicon has several chemical properties similar to carbon, it is possible this could be a new and completely alien life form, with respect to the specimens we've already encountered. Its internal mechanisms seem to operate like organs, giving it the ability to circulate plasma through its core systems, much in the same way blood flows through our bodies. These mechanisms enable the construct to distribute vital functions throughout its body. After further study, it may be possible to use these designs in our genetic modification program to reduce our soldiers' dependence on vital organs such as the heart.

Although they act as robotic medics, and lack strong offensive weaponry, we did discover a large explosive charge is located deep within the sub-structure it draws on as a power source. With this and several of the alien devices, I continue to be amazed by what their creators have been able to accomplish. Dr. Shen believes it may be possible to \"hack\" these drones, allowing us to utilize them for our own purposes.

Their bodies actually appear to be quite frail, with evidence of atrophy and muscular degeneration having occurred over an extended period of time. This is not surprising, as initial radiocarbon dating indicates this particular creature could be... several thousand years old. Unlike the other specimens we've examined, there is little to indicate that it was genetically enhanced, at least not with the same ambition as the others. \n\nStrangely enough, we have uncovered similarities between the \"Ethereal\" brain and that of the Sectoid Commander. Both show the same enhanced synaptic connections, confirming our suspicion that this is the likely source of their power. These Ethereals appear to have an incredible pool of psionic energy at their disposal...more than anything we've previously encountered, which helps to explain why the other species are subordinate to them.

strReport="As frightening and vicious as this species is on the battlefield, it is hard not to feel some sympathy for them on the dissection table. The specimen has been subjected to extensive biomedical modifications, some of which were undoubtedly quite painful and intrusive. The combination of living tissue and mechanical components gives the creature the look of a cruel, half-finished experiment. Most of the subject's internal organs have been replaced with a mechanical life support system that mimics their original functionality. \n\nA rather conventional propulsion system has been grafted onto the subject's torso, although the power cells supplying the necessary thrust are extremely advanced by our own standards. I have removed a number of neural implants from the subject that appear to aid in the evasion of incoming projectile fire.

strReport="Another variation on a previously identified specimen, this is the \"Heavy Floater.\" A cursory examination reveals substantial improvements to the armor and weapons systems available to the creature. Much of the exposed tissue, the Floater's most obvious vulnerability, has either been shielded or removed entirely. With these modifications in mind, it would appear the aliens chose to move towards a greater reliance on mechanical and cybernetic upgrades rather than continue developing the specimen's organic form. However, we have still uncovered a number of redundant organic systems within the Heavy Floater's torso that were clearly duplicated to enhance its survivability. If we were to follow a similar genetic modification path within our own soldiers, we may be able to prevent many of the life-threatening injuries that our troops face in combat. We may also be able to gain further insight into this creature's unique abilities in combat if another specimen is targeted in the field in the Unit Analysis View."

strCodeName="Goliath"
strReport="As it appears that the Sectoid creature within this mechanized armor is of the same biological makeup we had seen previously, most of our efforts were spent disassembling and analyzing the inner workings of the armor itself - in close collaboration with Dr. Shen's team, of course. As our soldiers quickly discovered in the field, this suit is equipped with two substantially larger and more powerful plasma weapons when compared with the standard Sectoid equipment. The armor itself provides a great deal of protection to the operator, while also maintaining an impressive degree of mobility. The suit is capable of climbing over rough terrain and seems to have no trouble even with staircases and other obstacles, as it is also maneuverable enough to operate confidently in enclosed spaces. \n\nOne of the more interesting discoveries we made while examining this subject is that the suit's armor plating appears to interfere to some degree with the Sectoid pilot's unique mental capabilities. I can assume that this was an unintended consequence of the additional armor plating - the aliens sacrificed what would appear to be an extremely powerful ability as a tradeoff for an increase in sheer combat power. However, it should be noted that the aliens seem to have offset this potential disadvantage by implementing a new technology. A small module located within the armor's core appears to serve as a sort of "amplifier" for these telepathic abilities. When targeted by an allied unit, rather than linking the two, the amplifier seems to take this power and use it to form a sort of shield around the suit. Our troops should be wary of this capability, as the suit is already quite formidable without the additional shielding in place. It does have one weakness: its large size renders reaction fire against it more accurate."

strReport="Standing well over two meters tall, the ratio of this subject's lean muscle to the rest of its body mass is staggering. Its bones are highly durable yet very light in weight, and it seems to lack extramuscular fatty tissue of any kind. There is no part of this subject that has not been genetically engineered for combat. These \"Mutons\" (a moniker given by the troops) have clearly been bred and modified from birth, with every enhancement contributing to its function as a sort of \"organic tank.\" As such, the Mutons are capable of withstanding otherworldly amounts of damage and seem to have an incredible tolerance for pain. \n\nDuring the autopsy, we also noted a variety of ritualistic markings and unusual tattoos, which imply some sort of past tribal structure among the Muton species. It may be this tribal nature that has led to the Muton's use of a \"Warcry\" in battle, which seems to cause a surge in adrenaline within both the subject and even nearby allies. With this in mind, it is certainly possible that we could replicate this ability through our own genetic modification program. We've also noticed a number of distinct similarities between the genetic structure of the Muton and Floater specimens. Although I can only guess as to the alien's intentions, it certainly appears that the Floaters may have at one time been Mutons themselves. If the aliens have been experimenting with the Muton physiology, perhaps the Floaters are a byproduct of their less successful attempts at genetic manipulation. \n\nWe may be able to gain further insight into this creature's combat capabilities by targeting another example in the field in the Unit Analysis View."

We've theorized that these \"enhanced electrical synapses,\" capable of transmitting nerve impulses at nearly three times the normal rate, are the product of careful genetic manipulation. If our theory holds true, that means the aliens are capable of modifying even the most complex tissue at a genetic level. In regards to our own genetic research, I am hopeful that we can use the Sectoid Commander's enhanced synaptic connections to improve the capabilities of our own soldiers, perhaps in a way that would redirect the psionic powers utilized by the aliens back unto themselves."

strReport="Although each of the autopsies we've conducted on the various alien species could be considered unusual, this latest specimen continues to push the boundaries of how we might define that characteristic. It's been referred to as a "Seeker" by our soldiers in the field due to its propensity for tracking and engaging with single targets - and its actual means of attack is quite shocking. Once it has located a target, the Seeker physically seizes the victim, and remains attached until it is either removed by force or the target expires.\n\n As one might imagine, this is an extraordinarily disturbing situation for both the victim and anyone witnessing the attack. The challenge in stopping the Seeker comes from its inherent agility and nimbleness, making it extremely difficult to intercept before it manages to reach its intended target. We believe the micro-motors employed in its design are responsible for this notable degree of mobility. The Seeker has also been observed deploying a type of defensive smoke screen, making it even more troublesome to engage during the limited window of opportunity when it is immobile. \n\n It is my hope that we can adapt these various concealment techniques into a form that allows our soldiers greater stealth capabilities in combat, which should reduce casualties.

Despite its outward appearance, upon dissection, the creature's unique organ and bone structure is revealed to be distinctly alien in nature. The subject's bones are segmented, rather like the vertebrae of a serpent. This segmented structure appears to give the creature a spectacular range of motion in combat. It is possible, through our own genetic modification program, that we may be able to replicate the unique connective tissues that allow for this remarkable flexibility. If successful, our soldiers could see drastic improvements in their own physical mobility and resilience. \n\nA large portion of the specimen's thoracic cavity is devoted to enormous glands capable of producing a toxin that is then expelled via ducts with considerable force.

The heat sinks developed using their materials have also proven to be the answer to proper heat dissipation along the weapon's barrel. With this knowledge in hand, we should now be able to use any plasma pistols we've captured from the invaders to manufacture variants of our own design."

strReport="Having fully analyzed the strange material recovered from the alien craft, it's clear this element is unlike anything found on Earth. The unusual atomic structure of this substance responds to direct bombardment from accelerated particles, resulting in an astonishing release of energy. Although the potential applications for this element are nearly unlimited, for now, our efforts are primarily focused on power generation and propulsion schemes. However, as this material does not occur naturally in our own solar system, we must carefully manage our available supply. \n\nDr. Vahlen's Personal Note: To think, this single element has the potential to change the entire economic structure of Earth's energy industry. If we were to discover the source of this material, our reliance on fossil fuels could disappear within a decade."

The functionality of the weapon itself had already been well-established by previous testing conducted by Earth's various terrestrial military forces, leaving us with little to determine outside of the energy requirements and effective range. \n\nAlthough the additional shielding required to protect our systems will necessitate a reconfiguration of our ship's hardpoints for the weapon's mount, I expect the engineering team will have no trouble fitting the device into position. If our pilots can successfully deploy the pulse against the alien craft, we should be able to bring down a UFO with minimal damage to the artifacts and equipment carried inside."

strReport="These weapons are among the most powerful we've recovered from the aliens, and we've already seen evidence of its devastating effect against our own aircraft. Unfortunately, it was clearly designed for a much larger craft with a greater payload capacity than anything we have currently available. In order to adapt the mechanism for use on our own ships, we've had to redesign the integrated power and cooling systems to a much smaller form factor. \n\nIf we do manage to successfully deploy this weapon, I have no doubt we'll finally level the playing field with the aliens in terms of air superiority. \n\n And as for our troops, while I was skeptical as to the merits of assembling another weapon based on our traditional methods, namely, large rockets carrying heavy payloads of explosives, we have made some interesting discoveries during our testing. Our prototype, the cleverly named \"blaster launcher,\" has been surprisingly effective in penetrating the alien's seemingly unassailable armor plating. \n\nWe've also improved on the integrated targeting module by implementing several of the design improvements observed in the alien weapons. As a result, these rockets are capable of guiding themselves, even when fired from an obstructed line of sight. I believe there is still room for us to hone this weapon's capabilities further, but it should be safe to begin manufacturing the current design as you see fit."

strCodeName="Avocet"
strReport="The alien alloys have proven to be extremely difficult to forge and manipulate for use in our theoretical designs. Machining the alloy was an arduous process, leaving us with limited options as to what it could be used for. Although we considered the alien alloy's density a benefit, one that made it ideal for use as an advanced form of projectile ammunition, the material proved to be so dense that it ate directly into the weapon's barrel...making it useless after a single firing. \n\nAfter a number of failed attempts, we finally managed to develop a magnetic "barrel" that propels the alloys without doing significant damage to the weapon, which has so far survived several hundred test firings during our experiments. With the \"alloy cannon,\" as we've been calling it, now operational, we've had ample time to study the effects of its design. Although similar to a traditional shotgun configuration, because of its specialized ammunition, the alloy cannon is substantially more powerful, and deadly. \n\nTesting on targets made up of a modified ballistic gel proved pointless, as the targets were completely penetrated by the alloy munitions, despite an average thickness of roughly two meters. Needless to say, this weapon will have a similar effect on any hostile targets our troops might encounter."

With those logistical issues handled efficiently enough by the engineering team, we proceeded in our initial prototyping. \n\nAlthough we spent a great deal of time studying the alien's own heavy plasma rifle, there were still a number of questions surrounding its enhanced functionality. Maintaining an acceptable level of energy efficiency, while also increasing the weapon's output, was not an easy task. The primary constraint of increasing the output was the added weight involved by the inclusion of a larger power cell. While this issue may not have affected some of the brutish soldiers employed by the aliens, there are limits to what our soldiers can realistically carry. However, by redesigning the power management system to reduce waste energy generated during the firing process, we've managed to strike a balance between all of these concerns. I should mention however that heat buildup continues to be a concern, and our troops will have to be aware of this when firing the weapon in rapid succession. \n\nHaving successfully test fired our prototype, as well as a modified version of the alien's own variant, we believe it should now be possible to both manufacture these weapons by adapting any we manage to recover from the field.\n\nThe constraints that ordinary soldiers face are... reduced... when considering our MEC Troopers, for whom we can manufacture a full-sized particle beam weapon."

With a limited pool of resources available for future projects, we'll need to manage our use of these alloys carefully. The engineering team is awaiting orders to begin the fabrication process.

Perhaps this was an intentional move on the part of the aliens, but in any case, the floater was extremely aggressive throughout the interrogation process. The most interesting aspect of its bizarre physique is the propulsion module integrated into the remaining portion of its upper torso. During controlled flight testing within the labs, we were able to observe how the Floater is capable of controlling and modulating the flow of power into the propulsion system itself.

strCustom="Based on our analysis, we have improved pilot training and our weapon systems to better target weak points on the Terror Ship class of alien craft. Our hits on this UFO will do additional damage going forward. We will also recover 20% more alloys and elerium from salvaging these craft."

[Tech_VehicularPlasmaWeapons LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Vehicular Plasma Weapons"
strSummary="\"With additional insulation to protect their computers, it should be possible to equip our Interceptors and SHIVs with plasma weapons. By integrating a larger version of the containment housing developed for our other plasma weaponry, the end result would be extremely effective vehicle-based plasma cannon.\""
strCodeName="Snapdragon"
strReport="As we've continually strived to \"even the odds\" for our pilots facing the alien craft in combat, one of our most important developments was the reverse engineering of their plasma-based weaponry. Having successfully created a variant for our troops on the ground, the most difficult part of our work was already done. Increasing the size and firepower of these weapons for an application suitable to our Interceptors and SHIVs was a relatively straightforward process. Once we confirmed that the units themselves could handle the stress associated with firing these weapons, it was simply a matter of scaling up the device and creating an appropriate mount. \n\nWe believe these plasma cannon are now ready for general fabrication in engineering, and I'm confident our pilots will appreciate the additional firepower it provides."

strName="Xenobiology"
strSummary="\"It is crucial that we gain a thorough understanding of the alien physiology in order to develop weapons and tactics better suited to combating them.\""
strCodeName="Mobius"
strReport="We've managed to successfully map the alien specimen's entire genome, although I wasn't entirely sure it would be possible using our existing DNA sequencing techniques. However, our success has led to the startling realization that this creature's genetic structure is quite similar to our own. This discovery has piqued the interests of the research team, as it only raises more questions as to the origin of this species...\n\nHaving examined several of the alien corpses, we've also observed a trend - key components of the alien's genetic structure are mirrored perfectly across each of the specimens. Although it is presumptive at this point to draw conclusions as to how this is possible, I believe it is only logical to assume this alien is the product of aggressive genetic engineering, well beyond anything conceived of on Earth. If the aliens are truly capable of this sort of manipulation at a cellular level, I fear we may have only scratched the surface of their technological advantages over us.\n\n In any case, further research is imperative...and while we've obviously made a number of discoveries working with the alien corpses, I feel we may need to acquire a living specimen if we truly hope to find the answers to these questions."

[Tech_Xenogenetics LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Xenogenetics"
strSummary="\"A deeper analysis of the aliens' genetic code has revealed that their cells are rife with the substance we call Meld. We believe we may be able to use it on our own soldiers. The invaders appear to have deployed canisters of this strange substance in human-populated areas, perhaps as an experiment, and we have also been able to extract some from alien tissues. It might also be a weapon of some kind. Further analysis could shed light on its potential dangers and applications.\""
strCodeName="Purity"
strReport="We now have achieved a much greater understanding of the aliens' enhanced genetic structure. We believe it is largely due to the amazing Meld substance, which appears capable of rewriting the genome to a precision design in a way similar to how we install computer software. In early testing, we were able to devise several methods that allow for direct manipulation of the Meld substance and its physiochemical properties. While searching our records for any references to a material with similar properties, I uncovered a number of redacted data stores created in the 1960s, but much of that information appears to have been lost. In any case, the advances we've made should allow for a wide range of applications in the fields of genetic modification, although we will need to build a dedicated facility to enable these potential research pathways. It is probable that the invaders are more familiar with Meld than we are, and may already be fielding combat elements that take full advantage of its capabilities."

[Tech_Xenoneurology LWCETechTemplate]
strName="Xenoneurology"
strSummary="\"With our recent insights into the alien biological makeup, we now wish to study the aliens' nervous systems. If successful, we believe it should be possible to create a device capable of incapacitating an alien subject without killing it. If our troops could capture an alien alive, perhaps we could interrogate it.\""
strCodeName="Spark"
strReport="After examining several alien brains, I believe we have found a weakness in their nervous system. We have built a prototype new weapon, the Arc Thrower, and we believe this device is ready for final production in Engineering. The mechanism functions on the basic premise of neurological disruption, emitting a focused electromagnetic pulse capable of confusing and incapacitating targets within a limited range. \n\nAs this is our first venture into the field of non-lethal weapons based on the alien physiology, it's safe to assume there may be unexpected results in the field. It's very likely that some aliens will resist the disabling effects of the weapon, in which case it might be more effective to weaken the enemy first. \n\nThe Arc Thrower is also constrained by our current power supply technology, which limits its effectiveness to one shot per deployment. Any captives retrieved from the field will have to be housed in an Alien Containment facility; I strongly advise we build that facility before attempting to capture live specimens. We will also need to autopsy members of that species before we can properly interrogate them."

strSummary="\"Our studies of the Sectoid's abilities to manipulate reality by thought alone has yielded a surprising result: Humans, with the proper training and technological aids, should be able to do the same. Pursuing this project may open an entirely new world of human experience.\""
strCodeName="Backfire"
strReport="A thousand rumors and charlatans over the centuries, and yet, in a matter of weeks, we have proven it is true: Humans, with suitable training and technological assistance, can manipulate reality by thought alone. We are still arguing whether to call this new branch of human experience psionics or noetics, but one thing is certain: With a suitable investment of resources, we can begin training some of our talented soldiers in specialized techniques to assist them on the battlefield."
