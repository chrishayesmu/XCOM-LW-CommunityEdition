strReport="After a number of failed experiments, we've finally succeeded in focusing an energy beam through a narrow-field lens while still maintaining adequate energy efficiency. The result are extremely capable weapons that have a much greater chance of inflicting critical damage on targets. We believe these weapons are now ready for deployment in the field, once Dr. Shen and his team complete the fabrication process. \n\nDuring our testing, we've also developed another prototype operating under the same principle, but relying on a modified prism to scatter the beam rather than focus it. We envision this weapon filling the same tactical role as a traditional shotgun, but without the ammunition constraints... and with greater damage output. However, as with our other laser-based weaponry, heat dissipation issues continue to plague these designs. \n\nWhile developing these systems for our troops, we also blueprinted a variation suitable for mounting to our Interceptors. Attaching this weapon to one of the ship's hardpoints should provide a significant boost in firepower to our pilots when engaging the alien craft."

strReport="It took an extensive effort by the research team to reduce the considerable mass of the larger alien plasma rifle. By replacing the outer frame components with composite materials, we've managed to substantially reduce the weight, without compromising the weapon's power output or accuracy. These reductions did coincide with the added heft of a larger power supply, but we still managed to net an overall reduction of several kilograms. The substantial increases in firing rate and overall damage output versus our other prototype variants also required some additional modifications to the integrated Elerium power cell. \n\nThe end result of this work is a highly advanced, mobile plasma discharge weapon that improves on nearly all aspects of the conventional X-9 rifle.

Although we are treading into an area of highly theoretical science, we believe there is a strong indication that the aliens function under a collective consciousness, a form of social organization akin to a \"hive mind\" as seen in various species of insects found on Earth. It wasn't until our first interaction with the Ethereal species of alien that we were able to understand the scope of the psionic abilities we had previously been exposed to. \n\nAlthough we've only scratched the surface in terms of developing Psionic abilities within a human subject, we've now theorized that it may be possible to join the aliens' consciousness ... to tap into their \"hive mind,\"  by successfully activating this device. \n\nHowever, in order to ensure the safety of XCOM's headquarters, we'll need to construct a chamber that minimizes the potential risks to the rest of the facility during the activation process.

Our testing has revealed a pattern of signals being transmitted at a wavelength never before associated with any form of communications or electronic transmissions. Although we should not be surprised at this point by the advanced nature of the alien technology, this particular discovery is a bit...unsettling. \n\nAs far-fetched as it may seem, several members of the research team have theorized that this device may be capable of transmitting and receiving signals beyond our own dimension. The implications of this possibility affect all areas of known science, and perhaps most alarmingly, indicate that the Sectoid Commander may have been receiving signals or...orders...from a higher authority.\n\nWhile continuing to analyze the transmission we've detected, we have also moved forward in our attempts to interface the device with our own satellite communications network.

The only means we've found to gather information from this equipment is by routing its internal power system through a crudely assembled interface that bypasses any built-in shutdown sequences. \n\nHowever, the alien data itself presented an even greater obstacle, as we're dealing with a programming language that is unlike anything found in our own systems. Fortunately, the research team is quite capable, and we quickly assembled a small group of our best analysts for the task.

The \"Chryssalids,\" as we're calling them, based on their reproductive habits, measure over three meters long from nose to tail, and stand almost two meters high when perched on their hind legs. Their attack is not only extremely deadly, but also necessary for their reproduction, as the intended victim is not immediately killed, but instead turned into what can only be described as a mindless shell, akin to a zombie, which serves as host to its offspring. When a human is bitten, an embryo is injected into the host and immediately begins to gestate. Once gestation is complete, which remarkably lasts only minutes, a newborn Chryssalid will emerge, destroying its host in the process. \n\nWe can only theorize as to why the aliens would utilize what appears to be a savage, unpredictable creature... in any case, this is certainly not a creature to be trifled with, and our troops would do well to exercise extreme caution when engaging this species.

Its internal mechanisms seem to operate like organs, giving it the ability to circulate plasma through its core systems, much in the same way blood flows through our bodies. These mechanisms enable the construct to distribute vital functions throughout its body.

However, we have still uncovered a number of redundant organic systems within the Heavy Floater's torso that were clearly duplicated to enhance its survivability.

As our soldiers quickly discovered in the field, this suit is equipped with two substantially larger and more powerful plasma weapons when compared with the standard Sectoid equipment. The armor itself provides a great deal of protection to the operator, while also maintaining an impressive degree of mobility. The suit is capable of climbing over rough terrain and seems to have no trouble even with staircases and other obstacles, as it is also maneuverable enough to operate confidently in enclosed spaces. \n\nOne of the more interesting discoveries we made while examining this subject is that the suit's armor plating appears to interfere to some degree with the Sectoid pilot's unique mental capabilities. I can assume that this was an unintended consequence of the additional armor plating - the aliens sacrificed what would appear to be an extremely powerful ability as a tradeoff for an increase in sheer combat power. However, it should be noted that the aliens seem to have offset this potential disadvantage by implementing a new technology. A small module located within the armor's core appears to serve as a sort of "amplifier" for these telepathic abilities. When targeted by an allied unit, rather than linking the two, the amplifier seems to take this power and use it to form a sort of shield around the suit. Our troops should be wary of this capability, as the suit is already quite formidable without the additional shielding in place.

These \"Mutons\" (a moniker given by the troops) have clearly been bred and modified from birth, with every enhancement contributing to its function as a sort of \"organic tank.\" As such, the Mutons are capable of withstanding otherworldly amounts of damage and seem to have an incredible tolerance for pain. \n\nDuring the autopsy, we also noted a variety of ritualistic markings and unusual tattoos, which imply some sort of past tribal structure among the Muton species. It may be this tribal nature that has led to the Muton's use of a \"Warcry\" in battle, which seems to cause a surge in adrenaline within both the subject and even nearby allies. With this in mind, it is certainly possible that we could replicate this ability through our own genetic modification program. We've also noticed a number of distinct similarities between the genetic structure of the Muton and Floater specimens. Although I can only guess as to the alien's intentions, it certainly appears that the Floaters may have at one time been Mutons themselves.

strReport="Although each of the autopsies we've conducted on the various alien species could be considered unusual, this latest specimen continues to push the boundaries of how we might define that characteristic. It's been referred to as a "Seeker" by our soldiers in the field due to its propensity for tracking and engaging with single targets - and its actual means of attack is quite shocking. Once it has located a target, the Seeker physically seizes the victim, and remains attached until it is either removed by force or the target expires.\n\n As one might imagine, this is an extraordinarily disturbing situation for both the victim and anyone witnessing the attack. The challenge in stopping the Seeker comes from its inherent agility and nimbleness, making it extremely difficult to intercept before it manages to reach its intended target. We believe the micro-motors employed in its design are responsible for this notable degree of mobility. The Seeker has also been observed deploying a type of defensive smoke screen, making it even more troublesome to engage during the limited window of opportunity when it is immobile. \n\n It is my hope that we can adapt these various concealment techniques into a form that allows our soldiers greater stealth capabilities in combat, which should reduce casualties. It may also be possible to use what we've learned to develop weapons systems and equipment that mirror some of these techniques. Our Unit Analysis View available in the field should provide additional specifics regarding this species' various combat abilities."

strCodeName="Viperus"
strReport="The subject's external appearance is that of a Caucasian male. I would guess its age to be approximately 35 years old, although it's quite likely this is an artificial effect intentionally affixed by the aliens. The specimen is roughly two meters in height, and weighs just over 80 kilograms. Despite its outward appearance, upon dissection, the creature's unique organ and bone structure is revealed to be distinctly alien in nature. The subject's bones are segmented, rather like the vertebrae of a serpent. This segmented structure appears to give the creature a spectacular range of motion in combat. It is possible, through our own genetic modification program, that we may be able to replicate the unique connective tissues that allow for this remarkable flexibility. If successful, our soldiers could see drastic improvements in their own physical mobility and resilience. \n\nA large portion of the specimen's thoracic cavity is devoted to enormous glands capable of producing a toxin that is then expelled via ducts with considerable force. After a thorough chemical analysis of the subject's venom, we've theorized that it could be used as a powerful disinfectant to treat our soldier's injuries in the field. Dr. Shen is working to develop a means to integrate this substance into our existing Medikits for future deployment. Targeting another example of this specimen in the field using the Unit Analysis View may reveal further details about its distinctive combat abilities."

Unfortunately, it was clearly designed for a much larger craft with a greater payload capacity than anything we have currently available. In order to adapt the mechanism for use on our own ships, we've had to redesign the integrated power and cooling systems to a much smaller form factor. \n\nIf we do manage to successfully deploy this weapon, I have no doubt we'll finally level the playing field with the aliens in terms of air superiority. \n\n And as for our troops, while I was skeptical as to the merits of assembling another weapon based on our traditional methods, namely, large rockets carrying heavy payloads of explosives, we have made some interesting discoveries during our testing. Our prototype, the cleverly named \"blaster launcher,\" has been surprisingly effective in penetrating the alien's seemingly unassailable armor plating. \n\nWe've also improved on the integrated targeting module by implementing several of the design improvements observed in the alien weapons. As a result, these rockets are capable of guiding themselves, even when fired from an obstructed line of sight.

strCodeName="Avocet"
strReport="The alien alloys have proven to be extremely difficult to forge and manipulate for use in our theoretical designs. Machining the alloy was an arduous process, leaving us with limited options as to what it could be used for. Although we considered the alien alloy's density a benefit, one that made it ideal for use as an advanced form of projectile ammunition, the material proved to be so dense that it ate directly into the weapon's barrel...making it useless after a single firing. \n\nAfter a number of failed attempts, we finally managed to develop a magnetic "barrel" that propels the alloys without doing significant damage to the weapon, which has so far survived several hundred test firings during our experiments. With the \"alloy cannon,\" as we've been calling it, now operational, we've had ample time to study the effects of its design. Although similar to a traditional shotgun configuration, because of its specialized ammunition, the alloy cannon is substantially more powerful, and deadly. \n\nTesting on targets made up of a modified ballistic gel proved pointless, as the targets were completely penetrated by the alloy munitions, despite an average thickness of roughly two meters.

With those logistical issues handled efficiently enough by the engineering team, we proceeded in our initial prototyping. \n\nAlthough we spent a great deal of time studying the alien's own heavy plasma rifle, there were still a number of questions surrounding its enhanced functionality. Maintaining an acceptable level of energy efficiency, while also increasing the weapon's output, was not an easy task. The primary constraint of increasing the output was the added weight involved by the inclusion of a larger power cell. While this issue may not have affected some of the brutish soldiers employed by the aliens, there are limits to what our soldiers can realistically carry. However, by redesigning the power management system to reduce waste energy generated during the firing process, we've managed to strike a balance between all of these concerns. I should mention however that heat buildup continues to be a concern, and our troops will have to be aware of this when firing the weapon in rapid succession. \n\nHaving successfully test fired our prototype, as well as a modified version of the alien's own variant, we believe it should now be possible to both manufacture these weapons by adapting any we manage to recover from the field.\n\nThe constraints that ordinary soldiers face are... reduced... when considering our MEC Troopers, for whom we can manufacture a full-sized particle beam weapon."

strCodeName="Snapdragon"
strReport="As we've continually strived to \"even the odds\" for our pilots facing the alien craft in combat, one of our most important developments was the reverse engineering of their plasma-based weaponry. Having successfully created a variant for our troops on the ground, the most difficult part of our work was already done. Increasing the size and firepower of these weapons for an application suitable to our Interceptors and SHIVs was a relatively straightforward process. Once we confirmed that the units themselves could handle the stress associated with firing these weapons, it was simply a matter of scaling up the device and creating an appropriate mount. \n\nWe believe these plasma cannon are now ready for general fabrication in engineering, and I'm confident our pilots will appreciate the additional firepower it provides."

strReport="We've managed to successfully map the alien specimen's entire genome, although I wasn't entirely sure it would be possible using our existing DNA sequencing techniques. However, our success has led to the startling realization that this creature's genetic structure is quite similar to our own. This discovery has piqued the interests of the research team, as it only raises more questions as to the origin of this species...\n\nHaving examined several of the alien corpses, we've also observed a trend - key components of the alien's genetic structure are mirrored perfectly across each of the specimens. Although it is presumptive at this point to draw conclusions as to how this is possible, I believe it is only logical to assume this alien is the product of aggressive genetic engineering, well beyond anything conceived of on Earth. If the aliens are truly capable of this sort of manipulation at a cellular level, I fear we may have only scratched the surface of their technological advantages over us.\n\n In any case, further research is imperative...and while we've obviously made a number of discoveries working with the alien corpses, I feel we may need to acquire a living specimen if we truly hope to find the answers to these questions."

It might also be a weapon of some kind. Further analysis could shed light on its potential dangers and applications.\""
strCodeName="Purity"
strReport="We now have achieved a much greater understanding of the aliens' enhanced genetic structure. We believe it is largely due to the amazing Meld substance, which appears capable of rewriting the genome to a precision design in a way similar to how we install computer software. In early testing, we were able to devise several methods that allow for direct manipulation of the Meld substance and its physiochemical properties. While searching our records for any references to a material with similar properties, I uncovered a number of redacted data stores created in the 1960s, but much of that information appears to have been lost. In any case, the advances we've made should allow for a wide range of applications in the fields of genetic modification, although we will need to build a dedicated facility to enable these potential research pathways. It is probable that the invaders are more familiar with Meld than we are, and may already be fielding combat elements that take full advantage of its capabilities."

If our troops could capture an alien alive, perhaps we could interrogate it.\""
strCodeName="Spark"
strReport="After examining several alien brains, I believe we have found a weakness in their nervous system. We have built a prototype new weapon, the Arc Thrower, and we believe this device is ready for final production in Engineering. The mechanism functions on the basic premise of neurological disruption, emitting a focused electromagnetic pulse capable of confusing and incapacitating targets within a limited range. \n\nAs this is our first venture into the field of non-lethal weapons based on the alien physiology, it's safe to assume there may be unexpected results in the field. It's very likely that some aliens will resist the disabling effects of the weapon, in which case it might be more effective to weaken the enemy first. \n\nThe Arc Thrower is also constrained by our current power supply technology, which limits its effectiveness to one shot per deployment. Any captives retrieved from the field will have to be housed in an Alien Containment facility; I strongly advise we build that facility before attempting to capture live specimens. We will also need to autopsy members of that species before we can properly interrogate them."
