how to light the skybox?

  -> make a user selected affecting light with the skybox channel checked.
     - if we need to have a special classification for this then we will make it at a later time

SKYLIGHT:
	CastShadows=FALSE
	CastStaticShadows=FALSE
	CastDynamicShadows=FALSE
	bForceDynamicLight=FALSE
	UseDirectLightMap=TRUE

    LightingChannels:  SkyLight


how to only light character then?

  -> Character Lighting Channel  not at this time as people will mis use it
  -> for cinematics (where character only lighting could be used) we just use the unamed_#
	    lighting channels!
