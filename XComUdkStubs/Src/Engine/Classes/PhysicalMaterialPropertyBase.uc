 * Then inside that object you can either have a bunch of properties or have it 
 * point to your game specific objects.
 *
 * (e.g.  You have have impact sounds and impact effects for all of the weapons
 * in your game.  So you have an .uc object which contains the data needed per
 * material type and then you have your MyGamePhysicalMaterialProperty point to 
 * that. )
