/**
 * Base for classes which provide data to the UI subsystem.
 * A data store is how the UI references data in the game.  Data stores allow the UI to reference game data in a safe
 * manner, since they encapsulate lifetime management.  A data store can be either persistent, in which case it is
 * attached directly to the UIInteraction object and is available to all widgets, or it can be temporary, in which case
 * it is attached to the current scene and is only accessible to the widgets contained by that scene.
 *
 * Persistent data stores might track information such as UI data for all gametypes or characters.  Temporary data
 * stores might track stuff like the name that was entered into some UI value widget.  Data stores can provide static
 * information, such as the names of all gametypes, or dynamic information, such as the name of the current gametype.
