// With full throttle applied, the tank engine will split up
// the MaxEngineToque across both tracks. This will be an even
// split unless the tank is being steered. When steered, the
// torque will be split based on the InsideTrackTorqueCurve
// according to its current speed.
//
// For example...
// When driving forward each track gets 50% of the total
// torque. However, if the tank is steering left and the
// InsideTrackTorqueCurve is 0.2, this will apply 20% of
// the engine torque to the left track and the remaining
// 80% will be applied to the right track. If the
// InsideTrackTorqueCurve is -0.2 it will still split the
// torque 20/80 however the inside torque will be applied
// in the reverse direction.
//
// Keep in mind that total torque is conserved across both
// tracks so if you were to direct 100% to the inside track
// there wouldn't be any torque left to send to the outside
// track.
//
// In addition, any track wheels with a positive SteerFactor 
// will have their lateral stiffness adjusted using 
// TurnMaxGripReduction/TurnGripScaleRate when tracks are at different speeds.
//
// TurnInPlaceThrottle allows you to set a reduced amount
// of throttle for turning in place.
