/**
* This class handles various waveform activities. It manages the waveform data

* the player controller to start/stop/pause a waveform for a given gamepad. It
* is queried by the Viewport to get the current rumble state information
* to apply that to the gamepad. It does this by evaluating the function
* defined in the waveform sample data.
