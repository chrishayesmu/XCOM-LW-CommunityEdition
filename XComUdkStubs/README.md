# XComUdkStubs

This directory contains the class definitions for using XCOM classes within the Unreal Editor portion of the UDK. These are separate from the `Stubs` directory, which is intended for building code against. The classes here are meant for use in creating new game content (such as helmets, bodies, etc).

To use, simply build this directory using the UDK, and ensure `EditPackages=XComGame` is present in your UDK's `DefaultEngine.ini`. Alternatively, check the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-LW-CommunityEdition/releases) for a pre-built file to use.
