          strReport="Despite our initial disbelief in Central Officer Bradford's reported visions, we have made astonishing breakthroughs in the field of close-quarters combat based on his descriptions. Our initial tests were sufficient to enable an ordinary man to punch through a two-inch wood beam. Subsequent efforts have resulted in exponentially greater results. All of our Muton Berserker captives have been beaten to death by Chief Scientist Vahlen in mutual combat, while Chief Engineer Shen has taken to building ever-larger robots for his newly built \"Battledome\".\n\nWhile the military applications of this technology are boundless, we have observed increased levels of aggression and territorial behavior in subjects. Many of our soldiers are now participating in underground boxing matches with chimpanzees and other great apes. In addition, operations abroad may become more difficult, as most governments worldwide have required our operatives to register their limbs as deadly weapons. Our access to the USA remains unfettered, however.", \\
