/**
 * KActor used for spawning "effect" type of physics objects.  (e.g. gun magazines)
 * This will nice "fade to nothing when it is dying.
 *
 *
 * So in PhysX2 when we use smallish collision on objects we will get tunneling and that will cause the
 * object to either fall directly through the ground or bounce a little bit and then fall through the ground.
 *
 * CCD currently is slow, has some bugs, and is a global setting (as opposed to compartment)
 *
 * So for physx2 you need to make a larger than correct box/shape and that should stop these RigidBodyies from falling through
 * the world.
 *
 * One way to do that is with the "Set Collision from Builder Brush" functionality.  Make a builder brush around the object and use that for
 * the collision!
