/**
 * Tracks all data about the current game state, such as players, objectives, time remaining, current scores, etc. Game data stores
 * can be nested, in that a GameState data store can contain references to other game state data stores. This is useful for
 * isolating the weapon data store associated with a particular player, for example.
 * Game data stores are further divided into two components:
 * <p>
 * Game state data providers:	Provides state and static data about a particular instance of a data source, such as a player, weapon,
 * 								pickup, or game objective. Data providers can generally not be referenced directly by the UI. Instead,
 *								they are normally accessed through a game state data store, such as the game state data store associated
 *								with the owning player, or the current game info instance.
 * Game state data stores:		Acts as the first layer between the game and the UI. Each data store contains a collection of game state
 *								data providers, which provide the data for instances of a game object
