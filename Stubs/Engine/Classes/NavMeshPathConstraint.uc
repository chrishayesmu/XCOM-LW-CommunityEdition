	 * EvaluatePath - this function is called for every A* successor edge.  This gives constraints a chance
	 * to both modify the heuristic cost (h), the computed actual cost (g), as well as deny use of this edge altogether
	 * @param Edge - the successor candidate edge
	 * @param PredecessorEdge - Edge we traversed from to reach `Edge` 
	 * @param SrcPoly - the poly we are expanding from (e.g. the poly from which we want to traverse the Edge)
	 * @param DestPoly - The poly we're trying to traverse to (from SrcPoly)
	 * @param PathParams - the cached pathing parameters of the pathing entity 
	 * @param out_PathCost - the computed path cost of this edge (the current value is supplied as input, and can be modified in this function) 
	 *                       (this constitutes G of the pathfinding heuristic function F=G+H)
	 * @param out_HeuristicCost - the heuristic cost to be applied to this edge (the current heuristic is supplied as input, and can be modified in this function)
	 *                          (this constitutes H of the pathfindign heuristic function F=G+H)
	 * @param EdgePoint - the point on the edge that was used for cost calculations, useful starting point if computing distance to something
	 * @return - TRUE if this edge is a valid successor candidate and should be added to the open list, FALSE if it should be thrown out
