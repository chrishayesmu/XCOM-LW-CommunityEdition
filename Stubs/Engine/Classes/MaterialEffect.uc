 * If they are bShowInGame they are still evaluated and will take up GPU time even if their effects are not seen.
 * So for MaterialEffects that are in your Post Process Chain you will want to manage them by toggling bShowInGame
 * for when you see them if they are not always evident.  (e.g. you press a button to go into "see invis things" mode 
 * which has some expensive and cool looking material.  You want to toggle that on the button press and not have it on
 * all the time)
