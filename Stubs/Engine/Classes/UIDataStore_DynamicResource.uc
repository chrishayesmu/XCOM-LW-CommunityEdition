/**
 * This data store can be used for cases where both static and dynamic information about a particular game concept must be displayed together.
 * For example, this data store could be used to display a list of levels which have been unlocked by the player.  The information about the
 * levels themselves would probably be exposed by a UIResourceDataProvider, but resource data providers cannot provide data about the player's
 * progress since they are static by nature.  The player's progress must come from something like a profile data provider that can provide
 * information about which of the levels have been unlocked.  This data store brings these two types of information together in order to
 * provide a combination of static and dynamic information about a game resource from a single location.
