/**
* The PhysicalMaterial objects now have a parent reference / pointer.  This allows
* you to make single inheritance hierarchies of PhysicalMaterials.  Specifically
* this allows one to set default data and then have subclasses over ride that data.
* (e.g.  For all materials in the game we are going to say the default Impact Sound
* is SoundA.  Now for a Tin Shed we can make a Metal Physical Material and set its
* parent pointer to the Default Material.  And then for our Metal PhysicalMaterial
* we say:  Play SoundB for Pistols and Rifles.  Leaving everything else blank, our
* code can now traverse up the tree to the Default PhysicalMaterial and read the
* values out of that.
*
* This allows for very specific and interesting behavior that is for the most part
* completely in the hands of your content creators.
*
* A programmer is needed only to create the orig set of parameters and then it is
* all data driven parameterization!
