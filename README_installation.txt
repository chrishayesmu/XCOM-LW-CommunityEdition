*         INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
*
* for Long War: Community Edition - Alpha 1
*
* If you are planning to write mods for LWCE, you will eventually need to setup your installation to be built locally. You may wish to do that
* instead of following these instructions, though if you don't, you can always change at a later date. Those instructions can be found here:
* https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-LW-CommunityEdition

************************************************


IN CASE OF ISSUES: You can reach out to the LWCE team at https://github.com/chrishayesmu/XCOM-LW-CommunityEdition/issues




Step 0a: Start from a clean installation of XCOM: Enemy Within.
Step 0b: Install Long War 1.0 (NOT 1.1 or Long War Rebalance) from https://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/88
Step 0c: You need to have PatcherGUI or Long War Mod Manager available on your system.
		 Get PatcherGUI as part of UPKUtils at https://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/448
		 Get Long War Mod Manager at https://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/620


NOTE: In the steps below, "INSTALL_DIR" refers to a directory within the XCOM: Enemy Within folder. The specific folder is XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW. For example, if your game is installed at "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown", then when referring to INSTALL_DIR below, you should be looking at "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW". If your path does not have XEW on the end, it will not work!

Step 1: Use PatcherGUI or Long War Mod Manager to install the file "LWCE_Install.txt". Make sure to keep a copy of the uninstall file that's automatically generated for you.
Step 2: Copy the file "XComLongWarCommunityEdition.u" into INSTALL_DIR\CookedPCConsole.
Step 3: Copy the contents of the Config folder into INSTALL_DIR\Config.
Step 4: Copy the contents of the Localization folder into INSTALL_DIR\Localization.
Step 5: You're done!

That's all you have to do. When you boot up XCOM now, you should be running Long War: Community Edition. The quickest way to verify that it worked is to start the game and look for a new option at the main menu labeled "Mod Settings". It doesn't go anywhere, but the fact that it's there means your installation was a success.

*        UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
*
* for Long War: Community Edition - Alpha 1
*
************************************************

In step 1 above, an uninstall file was generated for you. Using PatcherGUI or Long War Mod Manager, execute that uninstall file.

That's it - you don't need to do anything else to uninstall. You can delete those other files you copied if you want to, but it's not necessary.
